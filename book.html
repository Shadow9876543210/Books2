          World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a 
          simpler system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change
           comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions 
           - doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a 
           single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.
